<p>
    Check that the files discovered with <code>path</code> has the specified content.
    You need to specify a path pattern for the content to be checked. If the path resolves to multiple files
    all files will be checked in order until a match is found or all paths are explored.
</p>
<p>
    Setting this value without <code>path</code> will have no effect,
    it would act as if only <code>name</code> was specified.
</p>
<p>
    Use <code>comparator</code> to specify how to match the content.
